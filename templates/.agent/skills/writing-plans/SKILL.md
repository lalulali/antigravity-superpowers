# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming or writing-requirements skill).

**Save plans to:** `.artifacts/plans/<order-number>-<feature-name>/<feature-name>-task-<task-number>.md`
Each task should be written in a separated document.
Inside task file only consists of 1 single task with multiple steps, If there are more than 1 task, split into multiple documents

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**When creating a task, the task should be as detailed and complete as possible.**
Provide exact code snippets for both implementation and tests. Avoid placeholders or vague instructions like `"add validation"`.

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**

- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Antigravity:** REQUIRED WORKFLOW: Use `.agent/workflows/execute-plan.md` to execute this plan in single-flow mode.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**User Story:**
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Remember

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, use a single execution path:

**"Plan complete and saved to `.artifacts/plans/<order-number>-<feature-name>/<feature-name>-task-<task-number>.md`.**
**Next step: run `.agent/workflows/execute-plan.md` to execute this plan task-by-task in single-flow mode."**

Execution requirements:

- **Entry workflow:** `.agent/workflows/execute-plan.md`
- **Execution skill:** `.agent/skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md`
- **Enforced execution model:** `.agent/skills/single-flow-task-execution/SKILL.md`
- **Tracking:** update `.artifacts/plans/<order-number>-<feature-name>/task.md` (table-only tracker)
