# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.
**Entrypoint principle:** This is the standard execution entrypoint. Do not offer alternate execution modes.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: follow the single-flow execution model from `.agent/skills/single-flow-task-execution/SKILL.md`
5. Update `<project-root>/.artifacts/plans/<order-number>-<feature-name>/task.md` (table-only tracker) and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch

**Default: First 3 tasks**
if user mention which task they want to create first, you must fulfill user request.
If the user request unordered task, kindly inform user to start from the beginning

For each task:

1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (Read the plan document for the task you are working on—each plan contains bite-sized steps. If you are unsure which plan document to read, ask the user. Do not assume.)
3. Design should follow design system document that is stored in docs/design-system. Create robust design library to be used all pages in the project to use.
4. Run verifications as specified
5. Mark as completed

Design artifact:

1. Write design system documentation — save to docs/design-system/`<design system name>`.md and commit
2. Documentation should be micro
3. You are only allowed to create the document if it doesn't exist and modified if it already exist
4. You are not allowed to modified unrelated content except the one that you want to add or modified
5. treat this document as a living artifact and the rest of the document. rewrite from scratch & oversimplify the document is not allowed and breaking the rules
6. The content should be splitted into different section e.g. button, color, typography, etc.
7. any changes to this document will reflect all pages.

### Step 3: Report

When batch complete:

- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue

Based on feedback:

- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:

- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SKILL:** Use `.agent/skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md`
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**

- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**

- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
- Use `task_boundary` for coding tasks; use `browser_subagent` only for browser tasks

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**

- **`.agent/skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md`** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting
- **`.agent/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md`** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **`.agent/skills/single-flow-task-execution/SKILL.md`** - REQUIRED: Enforce single-flow execution with two-stage review
- **`.agent/skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md`** - Complete development after all tasks
